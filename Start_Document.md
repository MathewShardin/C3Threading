## Introduction
The team is set out to develop a travel itinerary planning application. The application can be used to select accomodation in different cities (travel stops). Based on the selction the application can generate a travel itinerary and write it into a file.

## Application Description
Using the application users can:
- Select a number of cities (locatons) one would like to travel to
- View hotels avaliable in the locations chosen along with their prices
- Calculate final price of the trip
- Save a final selection in a file
- Interact with an app using a UI MAUI interface

The application will be able to:
- Contain a DB with hotel information
- Parse a CSV file with hotel information into an internal DB (MSSQL)
- Sort hotels based on user preference
- Display graphs that outline hotel prices per city
